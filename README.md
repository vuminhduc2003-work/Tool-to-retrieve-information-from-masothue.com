# Tool-to-retrieve-information-from-masothue.com

This code implements a graphical user interface (GUI) using Tkinter to process CSV files with tax codes, scrape business information from a website, and save the results into an Excel file. The key elements are:

CSV File Selection: The user selects a CSV file, and the application processes the tax codes by scraping data from a website (masothue.com).
Data Extraction: Using Selenium, it opens the webpage, extracts relevant business information (name, address, representative, phone number), and saves it to an Excel file.
Pause and Resume: A button allows the user to pause and resume processing.
Progress Tracking: A progress bar shows the completion percentage and estimated remaining time for processing.
Logging: The process is logged to a file (app.log), including any errors encountered during data extraction.
Multithreading: The process runs in a separate thread to avoid blocking the GUI.
Data Display: Saved data can be displayed in a new window using the show_saved_data function.
File Saving: The application saves the Excel file periodically during processing, ensuring data persistence in case of errors.
Notes and Suggestions:
Error Handling: The code includes extensive error handling, such as retrying operations or skipping tax codes when necessary.
Browser Management: Selenium’s Chrome WebDriver is managed through webdriver_manager to automatically handle ChromeDriver updates.
Path Configurations: The file save paths are hardcoded, so you might want to consider using dynamic paths or asking the user for a save location.

To implement the tool you’ve developed, the following Python libraries need to be installed and used:

1. Standard Libraries
These libraries come pre-installed with Python, so no additional installation is required:

os: For file and directory operations.
time: For time-related operations (e.g., sleep, measuring duration).
datetime: Handling date and time.
threading: To create and manage parallel processing threads.
logging: To log and track application activities.
tkinter: To create a graphical user interface (GUI).
2. External Libraries to Install
You will need to install the following libraries using pip if they are not already available in your environment:

pandas:

To work with data, especially DataFrames, making it easier to handle CSV and Excel files.
Install: pip install pandas
selenium:

To automate the web browser (in this case, Chrome) and perform web scraping tasks.
Install: pip install selenium
webdriver_manager:

Automatically manages and updates the latest version of ChromeDriver, avoiding manual installation.
Install: pip install webdriver-manager
openpyxl:

To read and write Excel files using pandas.
Install: pip install openpyxl
3. Optional Libraries
If you want to perform more complex operations with Excel files, you may need:

xlsxwriter: To create Excel files with advanced formatting features.
Install: pip install XlsxWriter
